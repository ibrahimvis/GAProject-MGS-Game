# **- MGS** 

## **- Technologies Used:**
Html, Canvas, JavaScript, jQuery library.

## **- Approach Taken:**

0. the first day was only for reading the documentation and learning from other website such as w3schools.

1. Drawing Different shapes on the canvas to have a general idea.

2. then animating those shapes with simple animation from left to right, top to bottom, or diagnoly.

3. after the animiation part what I have noticed the shapes go out the canvas so I needed to have a collision with the outside walls.

4. after doing that I started playing with event listeners and controlling static shapes or a standing still shapes.

5. from that point came the design and adding collision to a samller walls and enemies where standing still.

6. after adding the collision I started to look for a way to make the enemy navigate in patteren looked for bunch of AI simple navigation but all of them relied on a game engine, and baiscally the soultion was 2-dimensional array that holds x, y, and the direction to load specific image.

7. then we added a pressure plate to load the second map 

8. the second map insted of enemy we added an oval or ellipse shape that if you get inside you lose the game, so I had to look for a mathematic soultion to this.
